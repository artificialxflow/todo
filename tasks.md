## Project Overview
A web-based platform for hosting theological discussions and debates, focusing on interfaith dialogue between Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The platform will allow users to:
- View and participate in theological discussions
- Vote on different perspectives
- Add comments and engage in dialogue
- Access content in multiple languages (English, Persian)

## Technical Stack & Architecture
- **Frontend**: Next.js with default styling structure (app directory)
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes (app/api directory)
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js (if needed)
- **Styling**: Next.js default CSS modules
- **API Structure**: All APIs will be implemented within Next.js app directory

## Phase 1: Database Setup
- [ ] Set up MongoDB with Mongoose
- [ ] Create Mongoose models for:
  - Questions
  - Options
  - Comments
  - Users
- [ ] Import existing theological discussion data
- [ ] Set up database indexes for efficient querying

## Phase 2: Backend Development
- [ ] Create Next.js API routes in app/api:
  - GET /api/questions - Fetch all questions
  - GET /api/questions/[id] - Fetch single question
  - POST /api/questions - Create new question
  - PUT /api/questions/[id]/vote - Handle voting
  - POST /api/questions/[id]/comments - Add comments
- [ ] Implement Mongoose schemas and models
- [ ] Set up error handling middleware
- [ ] Create authentication middleware (if needed)
- [ ] Create and maintain Postman collection:
  - Set up collection structure
  - Add all API endpoints
  - Include example requests/responses
  - Document authentication
  - Add environment variables
  - Create test cases

## Phase 3: Frontend Development
- [ ] Create Next.js app directory structure:
  - app/page.tsx - Home page
  - app/questions/page.tsx - Questions list
  - app/questions/[id]/page.tsx - Single question view
  - app/components/ - Reusable components
- [ ] Implement components using Next.js default styling:
  - QuestionCard
  - VoteButton
  - CommentSection
  - LanguageSelector
- [ ] Add user authentication UI (if needed)
- [ ] Implement real-time updates for votes and comments

## Phase 4: Testing & Deployment
- [ ] Set up testing environment
- [ ] Create test cases for:
  - API routes
  - Mongoose models
  - User interactions
  - Postman collection tests
- [ ] Deploy to production environment
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging
- [ ] Update Postman collection for production

## Technical Requirements
- Next.js 14+ with App Router
- Mongoose for MongoDB interaction
- Next.js default CSS modules for styling
- API routes within app directory
- TypeScript for type safety
- Postman for API testing and documentation

## Security Considerations
- Implement proper authentication
- Secure API routes
- Validate user input
- Protect against XSS and CSRF attacks
- Regular security audits

## Future Enhancements
- Add more language support
- Implement advanced search functionality
- Add user profiles and reputation system
- Create discussion categories
- Add moderation tools
